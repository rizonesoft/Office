# Rizonesoft Office
[Rizonesoft Office](https://www.rizonesoft.com/downloads/rizonesoft-office/) is more than just a software project; it embodies our passion and commitment to the business community. Recognizing the challenges many businesses, especially startups, face, we have made it open-source. Our primary motivation is to provide enterprises with the opportunity to flourish without being burdened by the often prohibitive costs of software tools. I founded Rizonesoft Office with the vision of equipping businesses with the essential tools that I wish I had during my early entrepreneurial journey.

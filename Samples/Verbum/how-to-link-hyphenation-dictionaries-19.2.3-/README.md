# How to Link Hyphenation Dictionaries

The following code sample shows how to enable the word hyphenation in the Rich Text Editor. To accomplish the task, you must first add a hyphenation dictionary to the 
[RichEditControl.HyphenationDictionaries][3] collection.

Once you link hyphenation dictionaries, you can enable or suppress automatic hyphenation in code or within the UI.
[Refer to the Hyphenation topic for more information](https://docs.devexpress.com/WindowsForms/401190/controls-and-libraries/rich-text-editor/hyphenation?).

Please note that DevExpress does not offer hyphenation dictionaries. In this example, we utilize an American hyphenation dictionary from this site: [LibreOffice.org - English Dictionaries][1]. You can download the dictionary source (including the license agreement) from [this link][2]. If you wish to use this dictionary in your application, please ensure the relevant license agreement permits it.

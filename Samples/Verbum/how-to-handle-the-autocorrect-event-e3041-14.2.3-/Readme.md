# How to handle the AutoCorrect event


<p>This example illustrates the use of the <u>RichEditControl.AutoCorrect</u> event to automatically substitute certain symbols and codes as you type in the control. You can replace text with strings which are calculated according to the text content being replaced, or even substitute text with images.<br />
Type in '%date%' to insert the current date, '%time% will be replaced by the current time. A number enclosed in percent signs will be converted into words. A dollar sign ('$') , as you type it, is transformed into a picture of a silver dollar.</p>

His horse would have ran off, if a shepherd who was coming by, driving a cow, had not stopped it.

When he had rested himself he set off again, driving his cow towards his mother\u8217\'92s village. But the heat grew greater as soon as noon came on, till at last, as he found himself on a wide heath that would take him more than an hour to cross, he began to be so hot and parched that his tongue clave to the roof of his mouth. \u8217\'92I can find a cure for this,\u8217\'92 thought he; \u8217\'92now I will milk my cow and quench my thirst\u8217\'92: so he tied her to the stump of a tree, and held his leathern cap to milk into; but not a drop was to be had.

Luckily a butcher soon came by, driving a pig in a wheelbarrow. \u8217\'92What is the matter with you, my man?\u8217\'92 said the butcher, as he helped him up. Hans told him what had happened, how he was dry, and wanted to milk his cow, but found the cow was dry too. Then the butcher gave him a flask of ale, saying, \u8217\'92There, drink and refresh yourself; your cow will give you no milk: don\u8217\'92t you see she is an old beast, good for nothing but the slaughter-house?\u8217\'92 \u8217\'92Alas, alas!\u8217\'92 said Hans, \u8217\'92who would have thought it?
